Oro Platform Empty Application
==============================

An example of an empty application using the Oro Platform.

This repository contains application configuration settings and depends on Oro Platform. It can be used as a starting point to build applications using the oro Platform.

## Requirements

Oro Platform is a Symfony 2 based application with the following requirements:

* PHP 5.4.9 or above with command line interface
* PHP Extensions
    * GD
    * Mcrypt
    * JSON
    * ctype
    * Tokenizer
    * SimpleXML
    * PCRE
    * ICU
* MySQL 5.1 or above
* PostgreSQL 9.1 or above

## Installation instructions

### Using Composer

As both Symfony 2 and Oro Platform use [Composer][2] to manage their dependencies, this is the recommended way to install the Oro Platform.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it and follow the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

```bash
    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

- Clone https://github.com/orocrm/platform-application.git Platform Application project with

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/orocrm/platform-application.git
```

- Make sure that you have [NodeJS][4] installed

- Install OroCRM dependencies with composer. If installation process seems too slow you can use "--prefer-dist" option.
  Go to crm-application folder and run composer installation:

```bash
php composer.phar install --prefer-dist --no-dev
```

- Create the database with the name specified on previous step (default name is "bap_standard").

- Install application and admin user with Installation Wizard by opening install.php in the browser or from CLI:

```bash  
php app/console oro:install --env prod
```

- Enable WebSockets messaging

```bash
php app/console clank:server --env prod
```

- Configure crontab or scheduled tasks execution to run the command below every minute:

```bash
php app/console oro:cron --env prod
```
 
**Note:** ``app/console`` is a path from project root folder. Please make sure you are using full path for crontab configuration or if you running console command from other location.

## Installation notes

Installed PHP Accelerators must be compatible with Symfony and Doctrine (support DOCBLOCKs)

Note that the port used in Websocket must be open in firewall for outgoing/incoming connections

Using MySQL 5.6 on HDD is potentially risky because of performance issues

Recommended configuration for this case:

    innodb_file_per_table = 0

And ensure that timeout has default value

    wait_timeout = 28800

See [Optimizing InnoDB Disk I/O][3] for more

## PostgreSQL installation notes

You need to load `uuid-ossp` extension for proper doctrine's `guid` type handling.
Log into database and run sql query:

```
CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";
```

## Web Server Configuration

The Oro Platform application is based on the Symfony standard application so web server configuration recommendations are the [same][5].
